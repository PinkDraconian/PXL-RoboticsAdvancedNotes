# Week 03 - 2 Drone physics

## Aerostatic vs aerodyne
Lighter than air / Heavier than air

## Drone forces
- Thrust
- Lift
- Weight
- Drag

## Bernoulli's principle
> An increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.
(Low pressure above wing, high pressure below)

## Pitch, roll, yaw
Nod, barrel roll, Noooo

## Thrust
Blade rotation causes thrust in opposite direction

## Collective pitch rotors vs fixed pitch rotors
+ More customizability
- Complex
